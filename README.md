## Inspiration
Supporting small businesses during the pandemic shouldn’t be a challenge. We as a team realized how difficult it is to actually find local restaurants that we could support. While [local news outlets](https://www.noozhawk.com/open_for_business) did provide a list of restaurants, it was hard to navigate.

We were also inspired when we realized that even though food delivery companies/apps help these businesses with their services, that take a large chunk of the profit at the end of the day.

## What It Does
Good Hood provides an easy-to-access way to see which local restaurants are open. Users can sort through restaurants based on cost and food type. This provides the community -- or neighborhood -- a way to find and support their local eateries.

## How We Built It
We used PyCharm, HTML, Python, CSS, Firebase, GitHub, and Android Studio.

## Challenges We Ran Into
It was very time consuming to reformat the information we got from the website so we could use it. The article did not have a consistent pattern for displaying the days, times, or food type, so at one point we just went into Firebase and formatted the data ourselves.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Monica - I am proud of how much HTML I was able to learn in such a short amount of time.
Alysha - I’m happy I didn’t quit even though I have a migraine.
Jordan - I showered recently. (no comment on how recent)
Abdul - Coming to this hackathon.

## What We Learned
We learned so much about front- and backend web development, GitHub, and app development.

## What's Next For Good Hood
Good Hood is in a great position to expand to include other cities and their local businesses!
